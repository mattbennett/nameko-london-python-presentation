FLOW:

INTRO:
- logo
- tagline
- apache 2
- age
- started at onefinestay, jan from MPC
- originally just a lib, evolved into framework

CURRENT STATUS:
- 1.2k stars on github
- in use at these companies

MICROSERVICES:
- fowler definition
- pull out key terms: distributed system, separate processes, lightweight mechanisms
- bear this in mind...

DEMO:
- create simple service (RPC greet)
- explain entrypoint concept [before running]
- run service in CLI
- call it with CLI shell

CONCEPTS:
- entrypoints are...
- dependencies are... [seques into...]

DEPENDENCY INJECTION:
- as per europython: say that string processing expensive is...
- switch out entrypoint? for http?

DEFINITION(S) AGAIN: (maybe?)
- depenendency injection lets you "hide" messy dependencies
- has some out of the box tools for "lightweight comms" (NEXT SLIDE early)

BUILT-IN / EXTENSIBLE:
- we've already seen http, rpc
- also events
- also websockets
- acknowledge that many tools/protocols to be used
- mention "community" extensions? sqlalchemy, redis, sentry, slack...

DEFINITION AGAIN: (highlight testing...)

TEST HELPERS?
- bunch of test helpers, want to highlight just one (?): worker_factory
- take advantage of dep injection

CALL TO ACTION
- talk to me afterwards
- come and get a notebook?
